Plugins are a way to extend the functionality of Zuby.js.
They can be used to add new features, or modify existing ones.
All plugins are installed by adding them to the [`plugins`](/reference/configuration#plugins) array
in your `zuby.config.mjs` file.

This page lists all the official plugins that are available for Zuby.js.
If you're looking for guide how to create a custom plugin, see the [Zuby Plugin API](/reference/zuby-plugin) page.

## Official plugins
- [@zubyjs/sitemap](/guides/plugins#zubyjssitemap) - Automatically generates a sitemap for your site
- [@zubyjs/share](/guides/plugins#zubyjsshare) - Allows you to share local development/prod server with anyone in the world
- [@zubyjs/image](/guides/plugins#zubyjsimage) - Optimizes images in your Zuby.js app
- [@zubyjs/tailwind](/guides/plugins#zubyjstailwind) - Offers seamless integration with Tailwind CSS
- [@zubyjs/purgecss](/guides/plugins#zubyjspurgecss) - Automatically removes unused CSS from your Zuby.js build

## Plugins
### @zubyjs/sitemap
The `@zubyjs/sitemap` plugin automatically generates a sitemap for your site.
It will be generated at the root of your site, and will be named `sitemap.xml`.
See it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zubyjs/sitemap) to learn how to install and use it.

### @zubyjs/share
The `@zubyjs/share` plugin allows you to easily share your local development/prod
server with anyone in the world using the Cloudflare [Quick Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) service.
This is useful when you want to show your work to someone else, or quickly test it on a different device.
Once you stop the server, the tunnel is closed.

Example output:

```lang="sh"
Zuby.js  v1.0.58  started in 379ms

┃ Mode     development
┃ Local    http://127.0.0.1:3000/
┃ Network  use --host and --port to expose

┃ Share    https://accidents-head-random.trycloudflare.com
```

See it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zubyjs/share) to learn how to install and use it.

### @zubyjs/image
The plugin for Zuby.js that adds image optimization support to your project
on top of the existing `<Image>` component.

It supports both build-time and runtime optimizations
and therefore works seamlessly with both static and server output modes.

By default, it performs build-time optimizations for images
on pre-rendered pages and runtime optimizations for images on server
rendered pages.
See it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zubyjs/image) to learn how to install and use it.


### @zubyjs/tailwind
The `@zubyjs/tailwind` plugin offers seamless integration with Tailwind CSS
to your application. See it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zubyjs/tailwind) to learn how to install and use it.

### @zubyjs/purgecss
The `@zubyjs/purgecss` plugin analyzes your app and removes unused CSS from your Zuby.js build
to make it smaller. See it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zubyjs/purgecss) to learn how to install and use it.
