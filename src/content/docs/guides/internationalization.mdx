import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Zuby.js framework is built with internationalization in mind and it's support in both `static` and `server` output modes.
It is very easy to add support for multiple languages to your application using the `i18n` configuration option.

## Configuration
Here's an example of a configuration file with internationalization enabled:
```js title="zuby.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'zuby';
import preact from '@zubyjs/preact';

export default defineConfig({
    outDir: 'build',
    jsx: preact(),
    i18n: {
        locales: ['en', 'de', 'cs', 'pl'],
        defaultLocale: 'en',
    }
});
```

With this configuration, Zuby.js will generate a separate page output for each locale.
The default locale is available at the root path `/` and other locales are available at `/de`, `/cs`, `/pl`.

## Usage
To use internationalization in your application, you can use the [PageContext](/reference/page-context) object
and it's properties `locale` and `locales` to get the current locale and all available locales respectively.
To localize the path of a link, you can use the `localizePath` function.
